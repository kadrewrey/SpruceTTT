## NOTES
Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the brief.
I have worked through the task and created an full stack app UI & API in this single project.
The database is also available to view using the connection string in the .env file


## Quickstart
- ** There's no need to switch to client directory ** 
- `npm i`
- `npm start`


## Playing the game
- You are able to register as a new player, by submitting a name, email and password
- For a quick start you can play as a guest without registering and this will select a pre-defined guest user you can play with.


Thank you
